Guess the number game algorithm:

1. Select random number 1-20.

2. Ask the player for a guess.

3. Is the guess correct?
   - Correct: player wins, end game.
   - Different: display if larger or smaller than the correct one.

4. Loop steps 2 and 3, if there are still guesses available.

5. Out of guesses, computer wins.
